  This is the fast route to install OSCeleton to use with Quartz Composer. The installation should take 1 or 2 hours to complete.
  For this to work I've used the processing sample to reroute the osc messages into a format that quartz could read. At the moment it only works for one person.</p>
<p>In this setup I'm still using the 11/1/2010 build of OSCeleton, it seems to be the most reliable version for osx at the moment. There's a <a href="https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton" target="_new">newer version</a> (with QC OSC support!) but I still get segmentation errors sometimes and jerky knee/feet data with that version. When there's a more stable build of OSCeleton I'll update this page.</p>

<p>Connect the kinect</p>
<p>  Open a terminal window and drag and drop osceleton from Sensebloom-OSCeleton/bin/OSX/ to a terminal window (starting from the finder doesn't work at the moment) and press enter<br>
  </p>
<p>Test it by standing in front of the kinect (in the terminal window it should say something like new user 1)<br>
</p>
<p>Start the  application sendosc</p>
<p>  open stickman.qtz</p>
<p>To calibrate the kinect should have a clear view and stand in front of it with both arms stretched and the upper-arms at 90 degrees. After a second or so it should work and you can move freely!</p>
<p>  Good luck, and please post back any of the patches or improvements you make!</p>

<p><strong>Common errors people encountered</strong></p>
<p><strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, either you're using the latest osceleton build (this error pops up now and then, but in between it works).
