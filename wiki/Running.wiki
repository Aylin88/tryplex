If you've completed installation procedure, and it's working it's time to play!

*To run*<br>
Connect the kinect<br>
Open a terminal window and drag and drop osceleton from the 'OSCeleton and sendOSC' folder to the terminal window (starting it from the finder doesn't work!!) and press enter

<br><br>
Start the  application sendosc from the 'OSCeleton and sendOSC' folder by double clicking<br><br>
open '01 01s_single_skeleton' from the 'QC' folder in quartz composer<br><br>

To calibrate the kinect should have a clear view and you have to stand in front of it with both arms stretched and the upper-arms at 90 degrees. After a second or so it should work and you can move freely!<br>
If it fails, reposition yourself a bit more to the front/back/left and try again<br><br>


It's best to open en play around with the examples in the numbered order, so you'll get an idea of how all patches work.<br><br>

To install the macro's in your library place them in the /library/graphics/Quartz Composer Patches/ folder. Quit and restart QC to activate them.<br><br>


QCosc can't open the same port twice so when you open a second composition it gives an error: 'Error opening socket on specified port. Please choose a different port.'.<br>
Quit and restart QC and open the composition again, and it'll work. Once a new version of OSCeleton will be around this error will be gone.
