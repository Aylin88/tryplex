Two promises for new students:  1) We will transform our aims, questions, methods, structures, rituals and tools radically during the course of your studies.  2) You will be expected to participate in this act of permanent creation.
Core business: Information society has transformed education into a core business to be explored and exploited; HyperWerk positions itself as the testbed to investigate innovative means for cooperative learning processes. To participate in this experience has become our main educational promise and purpose.
   
*answers to a question*
