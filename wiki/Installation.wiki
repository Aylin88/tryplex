=Installing Xcode, Libtool, Macports, LibUSB, OpenNI, primesense NITE, avin2/sensorkinect, qcOSC=


This is the fast route to install OSCeleton to use with Quartz Composer. The installation should take 1 or 2 hours to complete.<br>
For this to work I've used the processing sample to reroute the osc messages into a format that quartz could read.<br>
In this setup I'm still using the 11/1/2010 build of OSCeleton, it seems to be the most reliable version for osx at the moment. There's a <a href="https://github.com/Sensebloom/OSCeleton" target="_new">newer version</a> (with QC OSC support!) but I still get segmentation errors sometimes and jerky knee/feet data with that version. When there's a more stable build of OSCeleton I'll update this page and the source.

*Common errors people encountered*<br>

*Segmentation fault*<br>
either you're using the latest osceleton build (this error pops up now and then, but in between it works). Or the camera is used by another application, close any open programs and the terminal, disconnect and reconect the kinect. If it still fails, try reinstalling from the begin.
<br><br>

*Image not found*<br>
Maybe the camera is used by another application, close any open programs and the termincal, disconnect and reconnect the kinect. Or libusb is not installed (correctly) uninstall and reinstall by opening a new terminal window and type: sudo port uninstall libusb-devel and then:<br>
sudo port install libusb-devel +universal<br>
Restart your terminal program and try again. If it still fails, try reinstalling from the begin.
